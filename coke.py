cola = 'The primary ingredients of Coca-Cola syrup include either high fructose corn syrup or\
 sucrose derived from cane sugar, caramel color, caffeine, phosphoric acid, coca extract, lime\
 extract, vanilla, and glycerin.High fructose corn syrup or sucrose are\
 overwhelmingly the major added ingredients: one 600 ml bottle (â‰ˆ20.29 U.S. fl. oz.) of Coca\
 Cola contains the approximate equivalent of 15 teaspoons of sugar. However, contrary to\
 what is implied by the "cola" name, Coca-Cola syrup does not contain any kola nut extract.\
 Since no kola extracts are present in the recipe, the primary taste of Coca-Cola comes from\
 vanilla and cinnamon with trace amounts of orange, lime and lemon and spices such as nutmeg.'
